# Getting Started

## Setting up Your UniCourt Developer Portal

A developer account provides you with an API Key for accessing our APIs, a playground for trying out our APIs, and API usage metrics. To start using the portal please follow the below steps.


### 1. Login to Your UniCourt Developer Portal

- To use any of our APIs you must login to your UniCourt Developer Portal.
- Login using the `Sign In` button in the top right.

### 2. Subscribe to Our APIs

- After you login to the portal, navigate to [My Dashboard](/dashboard), where a new API Key will be created for you that has not yet been activated or linked to any of our APIs.

- To activate your API Key for a particular API, navigate to [APIs](/apis), find the API you want, and click subscribe.

- Your API Key is now subscribed to that particular API and you can make calls to its methods.

### 3. Try out Our APIs
- Navigate to [APIs](/apis) and find the API you want.

- Use the `Try it out` feature to get examples of the request and response shapes of our APIs. 

- This makes an API call to the backend service using your API Key and provides a sample curl request with all necessary input parameters and the real response.


### 4. Monitor Your Usage

 - You can monitor your usage towards the limits on [your Dashboard.

Depending on the API configuration, subscribing to one API may subscribe you to several APIs. These APIs may have related functionality or share a pricing plan. Requests against any of these APIs will be counted together in your usage.

UniCourt Norm APIs are in Alpha stage and available for customers to try out. If you are an existing customer, [please contact us to get access.](https://unicourt.com/contact-us)
